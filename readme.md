Where should ticks be for a given plot?

Let's start with just knowledge of the maximum value.

Why not just use the maximum value? People are used to special number bases.

* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* 5, 10, 15, 20
* 10, 20, 30, 40

Only so many ticks fit on a plot. Maybe 10?

How far from the maximum value is acceptable? Maybe one tenth of the plot?
One fifth?
