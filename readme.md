Where should ticks be for a given plot?

Let's start with just knowledge of the maximum value.

## Number bases
Why not just use the maximum value? People are used to special number bases.

* **1s** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* **2s** 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* **5s** 5, 10, 15, 20
* **10s** 10, 20, 30, 40

Hmm these are interesting because 1s are like 10s, just with different
numbers of zeroes, and **2s** * **5s** = **10s**

## How many ticks per plot
Only so many ticks fit on a plot. Maybe 10?

## Maximum value
How can we handle when the maximum value not is convenient? Let's group that
into

1. Add a tick above the maximum value.
2. Don't add a tick above the maximum value.

How far from the maximum value is acceptable? Maybe one tenth of the plot?
One fifth? Maybe it's different depending on whether it's up or down?
